This project was built as part of the Healthy Gamer MAYke-IT 2024 hackathon.

The intention of this project is to be a web based interactive emotion wheel. An emotion wheel is a commonly used tool to help people identify their own emotions, there is an example below ðŸ‘‡
The person starts at the more vague emotions at the center and then closes in on a more specific emotion by spanning out from there. This project also offers some time for introspection once some emotions
have been found.
